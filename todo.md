run time

random seeds

obs
- episode, test & fill buffer random all require running episodes
- test dosen't
- what things read & save to disk

Can I start to split based on sampling v labelling v fitting?

what happen when you use a run name twice?
- remove or iterate?

do average of test train rewards separately
- maybe keep separate lists (plus one combined)

ideas
- make pol, make qfunc (not initialize)
- hyperparameters should be loaded in (experiment class?)
- some things are added to hyperparameters...
- where does buffer live?
- optimizers should be dict

runner
- counters can hold rewards as well - runner class?
- writer
- counter
- hyperparameters

wanted func
- start experiment from file
- restart experiment from checkpoint (based on tests)
